/**
 * ProviderDriver / ProviderInstance — driver SPI as plain values.
 *
 * `ProviderDriver` is a record, not a Context.Service. The thing it produces
 * (`ProviderInstance`) is also a record — three captured closures
 * (`snapshot`, `adapter`, `textGeneration`), an id, and a driver kind. There
 * are intentionally no per-driver Context tags because tags are
 * singleton-per-runtime and we need many instances of the same driver.
 *
 * The only Effect service involved is `ProviderInstanceRegistry`, which
 * owns the live `Map<InstanceId, ProviderInstance>` and is itself a
 * singleton.
 *
 * Driver factories are functions of `(typed config, env)` where:
 *   - `typed config` is decoded once by the registry via `configSchema`,
 *     so drivers never deal with raw `unknown`.
 *   - `env` flows through Effect's R channel. Each driver declares the
 *     subset of infrastructure services it needs (FileSystem,
 *     ChildProcessSpawner, …) on its `create` return type; the registry
 *     layer's R is the union of those, and the runtime layer satisfies it.
