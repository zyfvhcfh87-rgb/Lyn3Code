# Relay observability

> For maintainers. Using Lyn Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

The relay Alchemy stack owns a shared Axiom trace setup:

- `t3-code-relay-traces-prod`, the OpenTelemetry trace dataset shared by the Worker, mobile app, and
  first-party relay clients
- `t3-code-relay-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped Worker ingest token
- `t3-code-mobile-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped mobile ingest token
- `t3-code-relay-client-otel-ingest-prod`, the dataset-scoped first-party relay-client ingest token
- `t3-code-relay-recent-spans-prod`, a view of recent request and endpoint spans

Alchemy stages append their sanitized stage name to isolate resources, for example
`t3-code-relay-traces-dev-julius` for a personal stage.

Deploy from `infra/relay` with the normal Alchemy workflow:

```sh
vp run deploy
```

Alchemy resolves account-level Axiom deployment credentials through its provider. At runtime, the
Worker receives only its scoped ingest token. Mobile and relay clients use their own separately
provisioned scoped ingest tokens.

The Worker emits Effect's built-in HTTP server spans plus endpoint and database child spans.
Effect's OpenTelemetry exporter stores semantic HTTP attributes below the `attributes.` prefix.
For example:

```apl
['t3-code-relay-traces-prod']
| where name startswith 'http.server'
| extend endpoint = column_ifexists('attributes.http.route', ''),
    customAttributes = column_ifexists('attributes.custom', dynamic({}))
| project _time, name, trace_id, duration,
    ['attributes.http.request.method'],
    ['attributes.url.path'],
    ['attributes.http.response.status_code'],
    endpoint,
    relayOperation = customAttributes['relay']['operation']
| order by _time desc
| limit 200
```

The provisioned view also reads the endpoint from `attributes.http.route`. Relay-specific span
annotations are stored under `attributes.custom`; `relay.operation` is one of the emitted custom
attributes.

Agents should prefer the provisioned view or APL queries for completed incidents instead of
tailing the Cloudflare Worker. The stack does not provision a separate query token. Responders who
need scripted query access use the authorized account-level `AXIOM_TOKEN` together with
`AXIOM_ORG_ID`; scoped ingest tokens remain write-only credentials for their producers.
