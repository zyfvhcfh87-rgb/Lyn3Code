# Server Update Architecture

> For maintainers. Using Lyn Code? See [docs/user](../user/).

Remote server updates use one stable systemd launcher. Foreground CLI processes do not self-update,
and a running server never edits its systemd unit or durable service state.

## Ownership

The service files under `<baseDir>/runtime` are:

- `service-launcher.mjs`, the stable process selected by systemd;
- `service-state.json`, the launcher's durable selection state;
- `versions/<version>`, immutable exact-version npm installs.

The launcher is the only runtime writer of `service-state.json`. `t3 service install` and
`t3 service update` may replace the launcher and state while the unit is stopped. Server children
only communicate with the launcher over their inherited IPC channel.

The state contains one active version and, at most, one update record:

- `pending A → B` selects B as a retryable trial;
- `committed A → B` selects B for ordinary restarts;
- `rolled-back A → B` or `failed A → B` selects A;
- invalid state fails closed so systemd cannot guess at a runtime.

Every write uses same-directory replacement plus file and directory fsync.

## Remote Update

1. The active server installs `t3@<target>` into a unique staging directory.
2. The target runs `__service-preflight` against the active database in read-only mode.
3. The staging directory is renamed to its immutable version path only after preflight succeeds.
4. The active child sends `request-update`. The launcher validates the child and target, writes
   pending state, generates the update ID, then replies `update-accepted`.
5. After a short response-flush grace period, the launcher stops the active child.
6. The launcher starts the target as a trial and gives it the pending update over IPC.
7. The trial acquires dependencies, binds HTTP, starts every long-running root fiber, and verifies
   that each root is parked at the activation gate. It does not run migrations.
8. The trial sends `prepared`. The launcher durably commits B before replying `committed`.
9. The child opens the existing activation gate, accepts commands, and publishes lifecycle ready
   with the terminal update outcome.

Post-commit startup does not call service `start`, `initialize`, `connect`, `load`, or `acquire`
operations. It only opens prepared gates and publishes prepared lifecycle state.

The launcher serializes child exits, IPC messages, and timers. A trial must report prepared within
120 seconds. If the trial exits or times out before prepared, the launcher records rollback and
starts A. After commit, B is active and normal systemd restart policy applies.

## Migration Boundary

Remote update preflight requires exact equality between the database's applied `(id, name)` rows
and the target release's migration manifest. A target with a missing, additional, renamed, or
unknown migration is blocked. Remote updates never migrate or downgrade a database.

This deliberately means any release containing a migration requires a local service update:

```sh
npx t3@<version> service update
```

The local command stops the unit, selects the new launcher and exact runtime, then restarts the
service. Its normal server startup may run migrations.

## Client Correlation

The update acknowledgement includes the launcher-generated update ID. After reconnecting, clients
wait for a lifecycle ready event carrying that same ID. `committed` completes the operation only
when the ready server is the target version. `rolled-back` and `failed` end it immediately with the
recorded reason. Older servers without an ID retain version-only reconnect behavior.

## Capability and Compatibility

The existing additive RPC and lifecycle schemas remain compatible with older clients. New servers
advertise remote self-update only when they have valid launcher context and a live IPC channel.
Desktop-managed servers direct the user to update the desktop app. Other process shapes provide a
manual command; the old detached foreground respawn path no longer exists.
